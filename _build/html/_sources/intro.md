# Introduction

This Jupyterbook has been created based on the tutorials of the course 14.388 Inference on Causal and Structural Parameters Using ML and AI in the Department of Economics at MIT taught by Professor Victor Chernozukhov. All the scripts were in R and we decided to translate them into [Python](https://d2cml-ai.github.io/14.388_py/), and [Julia](https://d2cml-ai.github.io/14.388_jl/). Jannis Kueck and V. Chernozukhov have also published the original R Codes in Kaggle.
